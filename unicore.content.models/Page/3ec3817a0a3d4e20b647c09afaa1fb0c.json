The 98% of leadership roles in the tech industry are filled by men in the world but this ratio is even worst in mexico. \r\n\r\nWe create programs that educate girls and women in the technology sector.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 programs: Epic Queen Chapter, Code Party and Epicademy.\r\n\r\n**Epic Queen Chapter** \r\nWith this program we make visible every month 3 women that are already in technology to become role models in a meet-up event.\r\n\r\n**Code Party**\r\nFor 3 hours in a weekend girls around 6 to 12 years are inspired by basic programming exercises to become creators of technology rather than consumers.\r\n\r\n**Epicademy**\r\nEpicademy is a series of courses that focus on two audiences:\r\nGirls 7 to 12 years that learn about science, robotics and coding.\r\nWomen from 18 and older who want to learn about technology in different areas and topics.\r\n\r\nOur model:\r\nThrough important alliances, we started meetup sessions in the most important co-working spaces in 10 different cities in Mexico.",
